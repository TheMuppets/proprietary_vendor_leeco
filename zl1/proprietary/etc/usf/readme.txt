  Cfg File Clarification
------------------------
Every line in the file which starts with '#' or space or
Enter (empty line) is considered as comment line and ignored.
Every line with relevant info is of the form: <paramName>  [<paramValue>].
<paramName> and <paramValue> shouldn't contain any spaces.
Between <paramName> and <paramValue> there is spaces or tabs.

------------------------
  Tx Transparent Data
------------------------
usf_tx_transparent_data_size    -       should be [8] bytes for Echo and [4] for Epos or [40] for proximity.
usf_tx_transparent_data         -       Example for Echo [2,0,3,0,0,3,0,0].
                                        format: [skip - 2 bytes, lower byte first e.g. (2,0) for skip 2,
                                                 group - 2 bytes, lower byte first e.g. (3,0) for group 3,
                                                 frame size - 4 bytes, lower byte first e.g. (0,3,0,0) for 768]
                                        note: 768 = 300 in HEX and byte is 8 bits so 00 in HEX is 0 byte.
                                        Example for Epos [2,0,3,0].

                                        note: 12288 = 3000 in HEX and byte is 8 bits so 00 in HEX is 0 byte (in DEC) and
                                        30 is 48 in byte (in DEC).

                                For tester, if rx exist, this param is obligation.
                                For P2P this param is optional. If it does not exist then pattern is taken
                                from the P2P lib.
usf_rx_max_get_set_param_buf_size - max buffer size for getting and setting rx parameter

                                such as proximity and gesture detection.
                                The feature also requires mixer path support.

                                for RX audio device arbitration. The following
                                bits can be set to enable audio devices:
                                bit 0 - earpiece
                                bit 1 - speaker
                                bit 3 - headphones

                                is compatible with. The default RX configuration
                                is used when there are no active audio devices.
                                Allowed values:

  TX MUX Params
-----------------------
usf_mux_enabled                  -      Set to 1 to enable MUXing, 0 to disable.
                                        When disabled all the other MUX parameters are ignored.
usf_mux_state                    -      MUX configuration. An array of bytes for each TX channel,
                                        with 0 for a C1 channel (appears first in a MUXed TX channel)
                                        and 1 for a C2 channel (appears second in a MUXed TX channel).
                                        C2 channels (1 value) can only be specified following a C1
                                        channel (0 value).
                                        In a normal non-MUXed configuration, all channels will have a
                                        0(C1) value. This corresponds to 6 diluted TX channels (assuming
                                        port count 6, skip factor 2) where each channel contains one microphone,
                                        like in most setups today.
                                        Any two channels with nearby indexes can be MUXed, by specifying
                                        C1 (0) for the first channel and C2(1) for the second channel.
                                        Each MUXed pair (0,1 sequence in the channels array above)
                                        will create a MUXed TX channel. The number of physical TX
                                        channels will be reduced by one because the MUXed TX channel
                                        will actually contain 2 separate TX streams from 2 microphones
                                        (interleaved by the MUX).
                                        Note that only nearby channels can be MUXed on the same physical channel,
                                        this is a limitation of this configuration. The channels needs to
                                        be arranged in the mixer path to allow proper MUXing.
                                        For more information please refer to the document "demuxing
                                        algorithm low level design".

                                        for selecting the first channel (C1) connected to the MUX.
usf_mux_c2_sample                 -     The sample value that will be used in the MUX select RX pattern,
                                        for selecting the second channel (C2) connected to the MUX.
usf_mux_sync_delay_compensation   -     Fixed adjustment in samples that will be added to the MUX select
                                        RX pattern after TX-RX synchronization, to compensate for platform-specific
                                        CODEC differences.
